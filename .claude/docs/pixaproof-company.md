## PixaProof Strategic Position
PixaProof addresses a critical gap in enterprise verification: **image authenticity at the point of capture**.

While EMAS eKYC verifies identities after photos are submitted, PixaProof ensures those photos are authentic from the moment they're taken. Together, they provide end-to-end verification.

### Enterprise Focus
The marketing site positions PixaProof primarily as an **enterprise B2B solution**:
- SDK integration for banking, insurance, and compliance workflows
- API-based verification for automated processing
- Audit trails for regulatory compliance
- Volume pricing for organizational use

The Community Edition (consumer app) is de-emphasized on the current website, with enterprise messaging front and center.
