# PixaProof Website Structure

## Architecture
Single-page mega landing with anchor navigation. All content consolidated into the homepage (`/`), with only Contact and Privacy as separate pages.

## Primary Navigation

```
Home                    → / (scroll to top)
Solutions               → /#solutions (anchor)
Technology              → /#technology (anchor)
About                   → /#about (anchor)
Request Demo            → /contact (separate page, primary CTA)
```

The navbar uses anchor links that scroll to sections on the homepage. On the contact/privacy pages, these links navigate back to `/#section`.
